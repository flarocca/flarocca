I am a software developer passionate about .Net and Azure.
I've learned a lot from the community so I try to give something back, that's why I am always willing to help!

I like writing so I try posting something every week on my blog. Check it out, feedback is always welcome!
The content I create is in Spanish 90% of the times, however as I said before, I am always open to help!

Reach out if you need help, I'll do my best!
